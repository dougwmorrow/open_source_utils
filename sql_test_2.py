The user is asking about connecting from a Linux server (that they SSH into) back to network drives on their local computer. This is an interesting networking scenario.

Let me think through this:

1. They SSH into a Linux server
2. They want Python on that Linux server to access network drives on their local computer
3. This means the Linux server needs to connect back to the local machine

There are several approaches to this:

1. **SSH tunneling/port forwarding** - They could set up reverse tunnels or port forwarding to make local services accessible to the remote server

2. **Network file sharing protocols** - If the local network drives are shared via SMB/CIFS, NFS, or similar protocols, and the local machine is configured to accept connections

3. **Reverse SSH tunnels** - Set up tunnels that allow the remote server to access local resources

4. **VPN solutions** - If both machines are on a VPN

The most common and practical approaches would be:

A) **SMB/CIFS mounting** - If the local drives are Windows shares or can be shared via SMB
B) **SSHFS in reverse** - Using SSHFS to mount local directories on the remote server
C) **NFS** - If they can set up NFS on their local machine

Let me provide a comprehensive answer covering the main practical options.

To access network drives on your local computer from a Linux server you SSH into, you have several options depending on how your network drives are set up. Here are the most practical approaches:

## Option 1: SMB/CIFS Shares (Most Common)

If your network drives are Windows shares or SMB-compatible:

**1. Install SMB client tools on the Linux server:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install cifs-utils

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install cifs-utils
```

**2. Mount the network drive:**
```bash
# Create mount point
sudo mkdir /mnt/local_drive

# Mount the share (replace with your local IP and share name)
sudo mount -t cifs //YOUR_LOCAL_IP/ShareName /mnt/local_drive -o username=your_username,password=your_password

# Or for better security, use a credentials file
sudo mount -t cifs //YOUR_LOCAL_IP/ShareName /mnt/local_drive -o credentials=/path/to/creds_file
```

**3. Use in Python:**
```python
import os

# Access files on the mounted drive
local_drive_path = "/mnt/local_drive"
for file in os.listdir(local_drive_path):
    print(file)
```

## Option 2: SSH Reverse Tunnel + SSHFS

**1. Set up reverse SSH tunnel from your local machine:**
```bash
# On your local machine, create reverse tunnel
ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 username@linux_server
```

**2. On the Linux server, install SSHFS:**
```bash
sudo apt install sshfs  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install fuse-sshfs  # CentOS/RHEL
```

**3. Mount your local directory:**
```bash
# Create mount point
mkdir ~/local_mount

# Mount via the reverse tunnel
sshfs -p 2222 local_username@localhost:/path/to/local/drive ~/local_mount
```

## Option 3: Python with SMB Libraries

Install Python SMB library on the Linux server:
```bash
pip install pysmb
```

Then connect directly in Python:
```python
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection

# Connect to SMB share
conn = SMBConnection(username, password, client_machine_name, server_name)
conn.connect(server_ip, 139)  # or port 445

# List files
file_list = conn.listPath('share_name', '/')
for file in file_list:
    print(file.filename)

# Download a file
with open('local_file.txt', 'wb') as f:
    conn.retrieveFile('share_name', '/remote_file.txt', f)
```

## Important Considerations:

1. **Firewall**: Ensure your local machine's firewall allows incoming connections on the required ports (445 for SMB, 22 for SSH)

2. **Network accessibility**: The Linux server must be able to reach your local machine's IP address

3. **Security**: Use credentials files or SSH keys instead of passwords in scripts

4. **Persistent mounting**: Add entries to `/etc/fstab` for permanent mounts
